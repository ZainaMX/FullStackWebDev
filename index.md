START HERE

As a self taught Python Programmer having completed 4 years at university studying computer science. I am tsking this year to direct my focus towards Python projects amd web development which I based my final year project on also. Last few months looking at the possibilities in the tech industry I have decided to focus on this area and then go from there. It has been overwhelming looking at all the different jobs, but I have noticed python jobs appeal to me the most as a lot of my extra study revolved around python projects.
I am interested in pursuing a Junior developer role in industry and have found interesting opportunities within government. All i need to do now is revive my python project and revise my skills so I am ready to start work.
I have a 10 day deadline.
Here is a rough plan of what I hope to achieve: the basics.

Day 1 [Now]:
Setting up. Planning projects for the week.
Writing up on knowledge. 

Day 2-7: Project Work

Day 7-8: Portfolio

Day 9: CV + Cover Letter 

SUBMISSION


Have Flask application.
Requires database.
Work on this.

End product.
Working website for Viral.
Database of information from YouTube.

Before this going to be using Git to create new project Viral.
Need GitHub desktop to simplify commits.

Where do we start?
First Conda.
Package manager. It is coupled with Anaconda and Miniconda. Miniconda is an installer for an empty conda environment while Anaconda comes installed with several other open source projects.
It can build and manage software from any language not just python. While pip is just for python packages.
Conda has its own built in environment manager which is better than creating python environment with virtualenv.
Conda has two channels at the moment, one is its default and the second is conda-forge which has open source packages.
One can avoid using Anaconda completely and directly install conda with pip.

Here I am using MiniConda. Following tutorial.
Setup to install all packages from conda forge.


Done.

Next.
We are going to be creating a Flask Application.
Flask is a web framework for Python. Another is Django.
We are going to be using a Flask API, SQL Alchemt as an ORM which has a PostgreSQL databse and Alembic for migrations.

INSTALLATION COMMAND.
Conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels flask flask-restful flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate alembic psycopq2

Ready to use.
Now we need a text editor.
Going to be using Atom.

Open git repository in Atom.
Ready to create conda env here.
Repeat the above but in the new git repo folder.
