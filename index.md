START HERE

As a self taught Python Programmer having completed 4 years at university studying computer science. I am tsking this year to direct my focus towards Python projects amd web development which I based my final year project on also. Last few months looking at the possibilities in the tech industry I have decided to focus on this area and then go from there. It has been overwhelming looking at all the different jobs, but I have noticed python jobs appeal to me the most as a lot of my extra study revolved around python projects.
I am interested in pursuing a Junior developer role in industry and have found interesting opportunities within government. All i need to do now is revive my python project and revise my skills so I am ready to start work.
